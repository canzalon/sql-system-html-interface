sql-system-html-interface
=========================

An interactive system for a sample Supplier Parts Projects (SPJ) database. It has a simple html interface which allows for the modification of J (Projects) records. Additionally, the system contains, while currently seperate from the aforementioned J system, a number of SQL files that contain scripts for maintaining the system in particular ways, which may be easily modified for other means. Functionality including procedures, triggers, views, and simple select statements demonstrate potential scripts to aid in the shaping and maintaining of a more complete system when it goes live. Additional information for each SQL script is contained within the files themselves.
